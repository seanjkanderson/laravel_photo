        Sean makes digital images as a creative outlet. Painting, drawing, and more broadly mixed media 
        served as a creative outlet growing up, but through his outdoor experiences, his father's 
        photographic influences, and a fast-moving world, he has transitioned to primarily using 
        photography for artistic self-expression. Born and raised in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, 
        Sean enjoys playing and photographing in big landscapes.
