    <h5> Project statement </h5>
    <p style="color: black">
        Wilderness and adventure photographer Galen Rowell wrote, “To capture that certain moment 
        when something living is in fine balance with natural forces is one of the most satisfying
        aspects of photography”. From a climber’s perspective, I often think of photographing humans
        rock or alpine climbing. A big appeal for me comes from this perceived purity of the 
        moment. While shooting climbing in the mountains, photographers such as Jonathan Griffith 
        or Marko Prezelj often strip away much of the noise of life. However, I think upon deeper 
        inspection, there still exists something for the viewer to be sold on. In one of the pure 
        senses, the viewer is being sold an ideal experience, a moment to try to attain oneself. 
        I read an article (that I can no longer find) about how through outdoor marketing and media
        we are sold an experience, convinced we need a certain piece of gear for that experience, 
        and ultimately sold the product instead of the experience we originally sought after. In 
        this way these seemingly pure images of alpine climbing are also selling us a product we 
        can usually buy. Whether it be the helmet the climber is wearing or the rope creating 
        separation in the frame, we are at some level registering the apparel and gear that such 
        an athlete uses. However, if we were to strive for even purer images in the alpine, 
        stripping anything more away is suicide, for alpinism at the limits is taking only what 
        is needed for survival.

        Stepping back, if we think more closely to the ground, consider the work of Dean Fidelman. 
        Throughout his photographic career he has worked on the Stone Nudes. He photographs climbers,
        mainly bouldering (over roped climbing)—due to practicality—in the nude. Specifically, he is
        making art nudes that are often implied and sometimes anonymous.* While he photographs both
        men and women, his (public) work is dominated by women, in part due to demand and his 
        personal preference. His work focuses on climbing, hence the Stone Nudes, and newer 
        projects are color-based aerial performance nudes.
    </p>

    <p style="color: black">
        Some other inspiring photographers in the area of fine art nudes are April McKay, Thomas Holm,
        and Bman Photos (example images shown below). Thomas has highly sophisticated compositions 
        with detailed editing. His subjects vary from desert landscape nudes to studio erotica. Bman
        Photos mainly shoots art nudes outdoors, and I believe got his start after attending a 
        Dynamic Nude MasterClass put on by Joel Belmont and Craig Blacklock. Compared to Thomas Holm,
        Dean’s images are quite raw. He seems to work with only natural lighting and without any 
        serious post-processing. This style of shooting is compelling to me as it feels more 
        “truthful” about the body and the moment. My goal is to extend Dean’s work to other 
        sports or lifestyles, while using different photographic techniques including slow shutter 
        speed and flash photography.

        There are many athletic pursuits that can be reduced to solely a body/form in motion. 
        While some activities necessitate gear, this can often be minimized using a careful choice 
        of composition (e.g. downhill skiing nude in powder can minimize the amount of ski and boot 
        seen). The list is ever growing in my mind but a list of the more compelling ones is:
        <ul>
            <li>Dance</li>
            <li>Bouldering</li>
            <li>Running</li>
            <li>Backcountry ice skating</li>
            <li>Powder skiing</li>
            <li>Slacklining</li>
            <li>Surfing</li>
            <li>Biking</li>
            <li>Free diving</li>
            <li>Yoga</li>
            <li>Horseback riding</li>
            
        </ul>
        Open to other activities, so if you have an idea please reach out.

        Another perspective on fine art nudes that I find compelling stems from Katie Lee’s trip with
        Eliot Porter in Glen Canyon right before it was flooded around 1956. The photos collectively
        convey a deep sense of individual freedom. While desert canyons tend to hold a particular
        sense of connection to the body, it’s worth thinking about what other areas of the planet
        can bring about similar sensations.

    <p style="color: black">
        My overall vision for this project is to collaborate with athletes (or more generally anyone
        with expertise in a performance art) to create images that convey the sensation of freedom 
        through movement, particularly in wild places. The gender of the subject is not restricted, 
        though some activities/shots may benefit from a specific gender. While some techniques like 
        slow shutter speed may be used more for tighter shots that focus on the body, the context 
        of the body of work is in remote, or at least wildly inspiring, locations. A large amount of the material is 
        likely to be in black and white, and large prints (24 by 36 or larger) are the target 
        display medium.

        *To introduce a lexicon adopted from Thomas Holm, there are various forms of art nudes: 
        implied nudes, which don’t actually show any “private parts”; anonymous nudes, which don’t 
        show the subjects face; and then generally art nudes, which when lacking the two 
        aforementioned caveats is generally something you can hang on your wall without it being 
        embarrassing with your family. It’s worth noting that anonymity due to lack of face does 
        not mean a close friend could not recognize the subject, particularly if they have defining 
        features captured in the photo such as a tattoo or birthmark.

    <h5>Compensation: </h5>
    <p style="color: black">
        Generally, I can only do TFP (time for photos). For particular shoots we can discuss moderate compensation 
        but that requires exceptional circumstances.
