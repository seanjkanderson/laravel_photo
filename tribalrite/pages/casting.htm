    <h5> Project statement </h5>
    <p style="color: black">
        My overall vision is to collaborate with athletes and anyone with expertise in a performance 
        art to create images that convey the sensation of freedom through movement, particularly in 
        wild places. The context of the body of work is ideally in remote, or at least wildly 
        inspiring, locations mainly with natural lighting. Some off-camera flash may be used to 
        create dynamic lighting effects. Slow shutter speed may be used to introduce more dynamism 
        of the subject with the higher aim of generating more authentic moments compared to staged 
        stills. A large amount of the material is likely to be in black and white.

        I'm also starting a very similar <a href="{{ 'ART NUDE CASTING'|page }}" style="text-decoration: underline; color: rgb(57, 57, 143)">art nude project</a>.

    </p>

    <p>
        (*) Would require renting extra equipment on my end and likely some test runs before the actual shoot.
    </p>

    
    <p style="color: black">
        In general, I'll aim to provide mood boards well before the shoot so as to establish the desired overall aesthetic.
    </p>
    
    
    <h5>Compensation: </h5>
    <p style="color: black">
        
        Generally, I can only do TFP (time for photos). For particular shoots we can discuss moderate compensation 
        but that requires exceptional circumstances. If you're interested in modeling for an art nude project 
        (can be implied and/or anonymous), monetary compensation is possible.
