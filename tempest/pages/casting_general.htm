        My overall vision for this project is to collaborate with athletes (or more generally anyone with expertise
        in a performance art) to create images that convey the sensation of freedom through movement, particularly
        in wild places. The gender of the subject is not restricted, though some activities/shots may benefit from
        a specific gender. While some techniques like slow shutter speed may be used more for tighter shots that 
        focus on the body, the context of the body of work is ideally in remote, or at least wildly inspiring, locations.
        The use of a slow shutter speed is intended to introduce more dynamism of the subject as this generates 
        more authenticity generally as opposed to staged stills. A large amount of the material is likely to be 
        in black and white, and large prints (24 by 36 or larger) are the target display medium.

        Activities of interest include:
        Dance 
        Free diving
        Bouldering
        Running
        Backcountry ice skating
        Powder skiing
        Slacklining
        Surfing
        Road biking (less minimal gear)
        Yoga? (harder to be “original”)
        Horseback riding
