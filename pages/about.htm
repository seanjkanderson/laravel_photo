    My first memories growing up are being out in the world. I grew up in a country of hills and weather,
    contours and uncertain light, blizzards blown south from Canada, gauzy summer days, sudden thunder
    storms, wind, and cloud trains: the light was always changing. Living on the edge of a small factory
    town, the surrounding countryside was expansive and took me in . I became part of it, and it became
    part of me. I believe this is what happens to anyone that spends time walking in and observing their
    own given or cherished landscape, large or small. Landscapes are an intimate part of us. They become
    part of our nervous system and emotions.
    </p>

    <p>
        Photography to me is - …beauty…solitude…meditation…expression… and grace. Maybe grace most of
        all, a moment or place illuminated in time, a sought after gift or understanding in which you realize you
        are not simply an observer, but at one with this mysterious world. It is a way of seeing and seeing
        again, finding deeper connections to the world around us. The novelist, Norman Maclean, wrote, “I am
        haunted by waters.” I find myself haunted by landscapes.

        I primarily photograph in the diverse landscapes of North America with a mostly minimalist view,
        although I try not to be dictated by any particular style or approach. I try to create images that distill my
        emotions and connect the viewer with the land.

        Thank you for your time and allowing me to share my world with you.
