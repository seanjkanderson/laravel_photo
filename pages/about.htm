        Phil Anderson is a landscape photographer primarily shooting in the diverse landscapes of western North America. With a focus on the minimal, he creates images to distill the moment and connect the viewer with the land.

        From the rivers and hills of his home in the foothills of the Sierra to the unmapped dirt roads of Nevada, Phil finds projects that create a sense of place. A New York native, Phil has gravitated towards the West ever since his first roadtrip out to California when he was twelve.

        Phil started out with film photography in the 1980s and recently dove into the world of digital photography. With a strong remaining interest in the analog, he is working on developing prints (they are not yet available for purchase).
