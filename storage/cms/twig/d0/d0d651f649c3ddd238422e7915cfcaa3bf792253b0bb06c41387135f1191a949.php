        Phil Anderson is a landscape photographer primarily shooting in the diverse landscapes of western North America. With a focus on the minimal, he creates images to distill the moment and connect the viewer with the land. 
        </p>
    
        <p>
        From the rivers and hills of his home in the foothills of the Sierra to the unmapped dirt roads of Nevada, Phil finds projects that create a sense of place. A New York native, Phil has gravitated towards the West ever since his first roadtrip out to California when he was twelve.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Phil started out with film photography in the 1980s and recently dove into the world of digital photography. With a strong remaining interest in the analog, prints are currently available for purchase by request.
